## Welcome to my page! My name is Vanessa Thorsten
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
I’m a biostatistician and data scientist with over 20 years of experience applying statistical methods, data management, and programming to address complex challenges in public health, healthcare, and social science research. Currently, I’m expanding my skill set as a full-time master’s student in the Data Science program at the University of Colorado Boulder (expected graduation May 2026).

My academic work includes courses in data structures and algorithms, frequentist and Bayesian statistics, data mining, machine learning, and applied deep learning. In addition to being proficient in SAS, I’m building fluency in Python and R and continually building my expertise in modern data science tools and frameworks.

Alongside my studies, I work part-time as a research biostatistician at RTI International, where I’ve spent most of my career. I’ve led statistical teams and contributed to more than a dozen large-scale maternal and child health studies, including randomized controlled trials, observational cohorts, and evaluation projects. My work spans the full research lifecycle from protocol development and study design to advanced modeling, data analysis, and publication. I've co-authored more than 50 peer-reviewed publications and actively support capacity building by mentoring junior analysts and collaborating with global partners across the U.S., South Asia, Africa, and Central America.

Above all, I am mission-focused and purpose-driven. My passion lies in using data to advance knowledge, influence policy, and create lasting, positive change for communities and families.
